# P9LPython
A work in progress P9L model file converter to the Wavefront OBJ format. The only currently known use of this format was to store map data in Thomas and Friends: Railway Adventures, developed by Minds Eye Productions in 2001.
The file structure is simple and contains three basic types: 'undefined', 'Mesh', and 'Spline'. 'undefined' and 'Mesh' seem to have identical structures. According to the file's header data, the map was last compiled on 2/19/2001, at 3:04:37 PM. The game contains many leftover development assets, so all sorts of information like this is present in many of the game's files.
